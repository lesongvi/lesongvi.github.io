<h2>Halloween Racism</h2><br><br>
Free candy and costumes. That's the spirit of Halloween; today at least. Every year new costume ideas are added, from the bizarre to the cute to the...racist?<br><br>


Every year the issue of costumes that personify racial stereotypes are brought up again, but this year there has finally been an effort to stop it. Students from the University of Ohio have started a campaign called 'We're A Culture, Not A Costume", where they depict students of differing ethnicities holding photos of people wearing the perceived offensive costumes. There include; geisha costumes, illegal alien costumes, Mexican donkey costumes, and even blackface and 'ghetto' wigs. The issue arises from the fact that people base stereotypes of certain races as a joke or a costume. Most response has been positive, however some say that this isn't meant to offend and, if it does, is done unintentionally. They also mention that Halloween is only once a year and is an opportunity to dress up in a fun way.<br>

My opinion: I can see why people would perceive it as offensive. When people wear costumes, they're intended to frighten or amuse others. Wearing a geisha costume, with knowledge that geishas are an integral part of historic Japanese culture, implies that people see it as a joke, and that being a geisha is 'weird' or 'abnormal.' Wearing blackface, especially, is extremely offensive, and I personally see no excuse to dress up that way. Painting your face black to look like an African American translates into the fact you do not respect African people because you see their skin tone as a joke. Wearing the classic Halloween costumes or character costumes is fine, but the minute people start to imitate portions of other people's culture and lives (portions that others take very seriously) is just utter disrespect for other cultures in general. <br>
